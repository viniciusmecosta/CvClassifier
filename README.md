# Curriculum Classifier

## REST API for Classifying Curricula Using Machine Learning Algorithms

![Logo](https://irede.org.br/assets/logo_irede_home-VlpXW9hL.png)

This project demonstrates a REST API that processes PDF resumes to return the field of occupation and seniority level, along with the accuracy of the classification. The machine learning model was trained with 26 occupation categories and over 3,000 resumes.

---

## Features

- **PDF Processing**: Extracts text from PDF resumes with high efficiency.
- **Machine Learning Classification**: Classifies resumes into 26 occupation fields and multiple levels of seniority.
- **REST API**: Provides a simple API for integration with other systems.
- **Model Persistence**: Uses `joblib` to save and load trained models for deployment.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Includes API documentation and performance benchmarks.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a solid proof of concept for a REST API that classifies resumes into specific fields of occupation and levels of seniority using machine learning algorithms. Trained on a custom dataset of over 3,000 resumes spanning 26 occupations, the model provides accurate classifications while offering valuable insights into PDF extraction libraries and machine learning models.

### Key Takeaways

1. **Effective PDF Processing**: After evaluating multiple libraries for PDF extraction, `pdftotext` was chosen for its superior performance.
   
2. **Comprehensive Preprocessing**: Text processing using `Spacy` (stopwords removal, lemmatization, tokenization) and hyperlink removal with `Re` ensured clean, relevant data for training.

3. **Model Evaluation and Selection**: Among the evaluated models, XGBoost delivered the best results, offering high accuracy in both seniority and area of expertise classifications.

4. **Data Vectorization and Persistence**: The use of `CountVectorizer` for vectorization and `joblib` for model persistence streamlined deployment and inference, ensuring scalability and efficiency.

5. **Accuracy and Performance**: The accuracies and confusion matrices demonstrate the model's effectiveness and reliability in both seniority and area of expertise classifications.

This project highlights the potential of automated resume classification and provides a comprehensive learning experience in handling real-world data, evaluating multiple libraries, and implementing a complete machine learning pipeline.
